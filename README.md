 Simple-Notepad-App
NOTEPAD MANAGER (Simply..Notes)

Hello world: I started writing this code as my first assignment given by my trainer at Codekul Training Institute. The design goals behind this app are:
	
	-Hastle free and simple UI
	-Quick Usability
	-Replacement of paper(waste on stickey notes/paper note-pad)

Mainly Used Concepts

	-Grid View (For Main Screen, where items can be added in future)
	-List Views (For displaying list of notes made by the user)
	-Adapters (For operations on the List)
	-File handling
	-Size conversion
	-Date settings and others

	I pushed this app in few updates, as and when I made some advancements. 

Basic Operations:

	-Make your own note with title (ADD)
		
	-View the list of all existing notes (Edit)
		
	-Edit your previously created notes (Edit)

	-Delet old/unwanted notes (Delete).	

SPECIAL THANKS
	
Special thanks to my Trainer Mr. Aniruddha from www.codekul.com, for all his training, guidance, motivation and expert suggestions throught the training and even after that.

FROM "Me"

In the sea of android, though, a lot of awesome apps and codes are available on "Notepad", but you can refer this code as the basic code as an Android starter one, and redevelope a new form with adding many other functionalities. 

Thank You.
